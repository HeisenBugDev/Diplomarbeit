Hello. This is the HeisenBugDev blog. We will be posting updates regarding how things are going here. Why the German title? HeisenBugDev has a very Quantum physics-ey theme to the naming and a lot of important figures in the research of this field were German. You will notice that the comments are powered by our Discourse forum, this will allow us to achieve Maximum Awesomenessâ„¢.

Anyway, what's been going on with HeisenBugDev? Not much talk in a while.
